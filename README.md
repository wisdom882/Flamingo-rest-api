## üßê `Rest Api details`
> A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding. I created a Rest API for my frontend to handle my user data after athentication, my uploaded pictures to google cloud, my routes and also the football info webite functionalites.


## üßê `Technologies Used`
-This project uses [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
-   For the controllers I implemented functions that getsUsers, UpdateUsers, loginUsers...etc
-   I created a User model scheme using mongoose wi=hich had firstname, lastname, email...etc
-   The middleware was implemented with the help of the [JWT](https://jwt.io/). I has a function
"protect" to guard the routes.
-   The routes were implemented with the [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) framework.
this  contains all the routes for the frontend application.
